Welcome to ProjectTranslate, which is the perfect program for learning any language!

Compile using "javac *.java" and run using "java Main"

Note: This program uses a Google Translate API, which can be picky. Give the program at least 5 seconds from the start
before clicking on any buttons. If you are stuck on a loading screen, check the terminal to see if the translations
are stuck. If this is the case, see if you have any unusual words added to flashcards.txt. Also, rerunning the program without any changes usually works. This is out of the control of the developers of ProjectTranslate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before Compiling: flashcards.txt

-Specify the language you'd like the translations to be based on in Parts 1 and 2 in the first line of flashcards.txt.
-See here for the appropriate way to list your language:
-Type in one English word per line underneath your language specification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part1: Translator:

-Click on the Translator button at the top of the screen.
-Type in English words into the box.
-Click "enter" to have them translate into the language specified in flashcards.txt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part2: Flashcards:

Click on the Quizlet button at the top of the screen.
-Click Shuffle if you want to switch the order of the words. 
-Click the right button if you study the word and donâ€™t want to see it again. 
-Click restart if you want all the words to appear again (including those you removed from the flashcard.txt when you clicked the right button).
-Click the X button to revise the word later(the word will reappear at the end).
-Click the forward button to go to the next word pair.
-Click the flip button(up/down icon) to switch between English and the language specified in flashcards.txt.
-Click the backward button to go to the previous word pair.

Part3: Asteroids:

Learning languages can now be even more exciting than the green Duolingo Owl threatening you if you don't study:
-Asteroids with translated words fall from the sky.
-Type in the original word before they hit the ground, or else you will lose a life
-If you make a typo, use the Backspace key to clear your input
-If you type a key that is not a part of the English alphabet or Backspace, nothing will happen
-Do not try to type uppercase letters by holding the Shift key; nothing will happen
-When the correct word is typed, the asteroid will automatically disappear (No need to press a specific key)
-If you lose all of your lives, the game will end

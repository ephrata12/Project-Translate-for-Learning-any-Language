Welcome to ProjectTranslate: The perfect program to learn any language!

Compile using "javac *.java" and run using "java Main"

Note: This program uses a Google Translate api, which can be picky. Give the program at least 5 seconds from start
before clicking on any buttons. If you are stuck on a loading screen, check the terminal to see if the translations
are stuck. If this is the case, see if you have any unusual words added to flashcards.txt. Also, running the program
again without any changes usually works. This is out of the control of the developers of ProjectTranslate.

Part3: Asteroids:

Learning languages can now be even more exciting than the green Duolingo Owl threating you if you don't study:
-Asteroids with translated words fall from the sky.
-Type in the original word before they hit the ground or else you will lose a life
-If you make a typo, use the Backspace key to clear your input
-If you type a key that is not a part of the English alphabet or Backspace, nothing will happen
-Do not try to type uppercase letters by holding the Shift key, nothing will happen
-When the correct word is typed, the asteroid will automatically disappear (No need to press a specific key)
-If you lose all of your lives, the game will end
